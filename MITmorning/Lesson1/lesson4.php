//Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions
//To allow your code to perform diff actions based on diff variables
//php has the following if conditional statements

//1. if statement - executes some code if one condition is true
//2. if ...else statement - executes some code if a condition is true and another code if that condition is false
//3. if...elseif...else statement - executes diff codes for more than two conditions
//switch statement - select one of many blocks of code to be executed

//if(condition to examine){
//    code to be executed if condition is true
//}
//1. if statement - executes some code if one condition is true
